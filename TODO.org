* History Improvements
** Undelete
There isn't a good way to undelete. At the moment it involves:
 1. Save a document with the same name as what you want to recover.
 2. Go to a past version of that document.
 3. 'Save As' to recover that past version.

** Change Notifications
If someone else makes changes, we'd like a notification, with options:
 + Revert (refresh)
 + Merge
 + Overwrite

** Metadata
We have the option to enter a commit message on 'Save As' and 'Delete'.

We should save this and display it somewhere.
